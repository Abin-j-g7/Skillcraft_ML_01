🏠 House Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technologies.
The aim is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, condition, and more.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle’s House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques competition.

train.csv → Training dataset with house features and sale prices.

test.csv → Test dataset without sale prices.

sample_submission.csv → Example output format.

🔑 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded train & test data.

Explored feature types and missing values.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features with StandardScaler.

Model Training

Split dataset into train & validation sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model.

Evaluated performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Prediction

Generated predictions on test data.

Exported results for Kaggle submission.

📊 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

🚀 Results

Successfully implemented a regression model to predict house prices.

Achieved good performance on validation data using RMSE.

Model ready for further improvement with advanced algorithms.

📌 Future Enhancements

Implement advanced regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Feature engineering (interaction terms, log transforms).
